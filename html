    const plottext = "<b>Exposition:</b> <br><br> The book stars the 13 year old boy Michael O'Shaunessey, who lives in Nazi Germany and is gifted with a photographic memory. His father is the Irish ambassador to Germany, and as such him and his family reside in Berlin. However, they aren't Nazis themselves. They are spies of the Irish intelligence, and they pass on information to the British.<br><br>One day, Michael hears that his group in the Hitler Youth is going to be trying to find a British pilot that had reportedly parachuted only a few kilometers from Berlin. Micheal, luckily, finds the British pilot before the rest of his group. He hides the British pilot, whose name is Simon, in a barn not too far away. Later, him and his parents come back to the barn to find Simon and bring him to the embassy. There, in the barn, Simon reveals some shocking news; the Germans were developing a wonder weapon: a jet plane. It would be twice as fast as any Allied aircraft, and if developed, would make sure that the Allies had little to no air superiority and could result in a full scale invasion of Britain. Simon was sent to take photos of their prototype of the plane when he was shot down. The Germans call it \"Projekt 1065\".<br><br>  <b>Rising Action:</b><br><br> Only a while after, Michael finds his friend, Fritz, has the blueprints to the plane. Fritz's father works for the air force, and Fritz took the blueprints from his father's study. Michael tells his parents and they resolve a plan to use Michael's photographic memory and get all the blueprints of the plane. <br><br> Over time, Michael becomes closer to Fritz and Simon, and starts spending more time with both of them. Micheal applies for a special unit in the Hitler Youth, known as the \"SRD\", to get closer to Fritz. You could call it the secret police of the Hitler Youth. <br><br>When Michael gets all the blueprints, his parents try to send the blueprints with Simon so that both could escape Germany. However, Simon ends up getting lost and coming back to the embassy after a few days. Meanwhile, Fritz is selected for a secret project, which Michael's parents inform him is an assasination attempt of Professor Goldsmit, who was close to creating an atomic bomb and would be attending a confrence in Switzerland. Michael tries his best to get on the team and try and stop the assasination. After one of the members of the secret assignment dies during a bombing, and his replacement is beat up by Michael so that he cannot attend the assasination, there is an open spot in the team. As a final, planned act to gain the trust of the officers in charge of the team, he admits his parents are spies and harboring a British airman. His parents, as part of the plan, were long gone, but unfortunately, Simon was caught right as he tried to run. Simon, being Jewish, knew what awaited him in the camps, and decided to punch an officer and get himself shot so he won't suffer. <br><br><b>Climax:</b><br><br>Michael arrives in Switzerland and learns the nature of the plan. They have a disassembled bomb with its parts spread out in all of thier seperate suitcases. They are to assemble the bomb and put it in the avalanche shelter of the resort. They will then warn the staff of an avalanche, at which point everyone, including Professor Goldsmit, will go to the shelter and explode. Michael also brought the plans for the jet plane to give to Professor Goldsmit.<br><br> However, Fritz sees the plans Michael has and knows that Michael will betray them. Knowing Michael would try to save the professor, he takes the suitcase with the bomb onto the roof of the cable car, knowing that is the only way Michael can escape. Michael climbs on top of the cable car roof and fights Fritz. The bomb is knocked out of Fritz's hands and explodes only moments after. They continue fighting, but the mountainside loosened by the bomb gives away, and an avalanche starts. Michael manages to hold onto the cable car, but Fritz doesn't, and is gone when the snow clears, certainly dead. <br><br><b>Falling Action:</b><br><br> Michael is taken from Switzerland back to Britain and Ireland. Though he lost the blueprints in Switzerland, he reconstructs what he can from memory. He is unfortunately told by a British officer that he cannot tell anyone about his exploits, as it could expose the other spies they have in Germany. Michael reflects that though they couldn't tell anyone, they had still fought for freedom. ";
    const chartext = "<h3>List of characters:</h3><ul><li><b>Michael O’Shaunessey: </b>A 13 year old Irish boy with a mop of brown hair. His father is the Irish ambassador to Germany, but his parents are actually spies for the Irish intelligence, who give info to the British. Michael hates the Nazis for what they have done and what they keep doing, and works to stop them at all costs. His photographic memory helps with this. He progresses to become more mature and understanding of the sacrifices that must be made for the greater good.</li><li><b>Fritz Brendler: </b>Often referred to as short. According to Michael, he looked \” like he was 10 years old, not thirteen\”. He plays an important role in the story, as getting closer to Fritz is the main way that Michael gets to see the plans for the plane. Fritz also becomes a major obstacle in the climax, where he tries to kill Professor Goldsmit.</li><li><b>Simon Cohen: </b>A crashed British pilot who was sent to take photos of the new plane that the Germans were developing. He has a deathly fear of birds, which is ironic, as he flies airplanes. He is kind and jokes around a lot.</li></ul>";
    const settext = "The majority of the book takes place in 1943 Berlin, where Michael cycles through the Irish embassy, dinner parties with important figures in Germany, and his Hitler Youth class. However, all of these settings are in Berlin. Berlin itself in a state of semi-ruin, as allied bombs have hit many buildings. Nearing the end of the book, the setting changes drastically. Michael now ends up at the top of a mountain at a resort in Switzerland. Switzerland is not affected by the horrors of war, and as such, many tourists and vacationeers are present in this setting. It is very cold and the mountainside is very steep.";
    const context = "<b>Irish spies were present in Germany at the time. </b>It was officially declassified in the late 1900's that Ireland, despite being neutral throughout the war, was secretly sending spies and passing on info to the British. Though Michael and his family are fictional people, their job and situation is similar to those of many Irish spies at that time.<br><br><b>Projekt 1065 was an actual project to develop the world's first jet plane.</b> While the story is fiction, the project that developed the Me262 was actally called Projekt 1065. \"Projekt\" is the german spelling of \"Project\", and as succh the author used it to make the book feel more real."
